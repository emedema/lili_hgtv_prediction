# lili_hgtv_prediction

HGTV's Love it or List it Vancouver is a unique format of show on the network. Specifically, there are very few shows that feature a binary outcome that could potentially be predicted.

I am also interested in if there are certain factors within the couple, budget, or reno that heavily affect the outcome.

## Process

### Data Collection

First, we must collect the data that we will use in our prediction. This is done through a mixture of scraping and manual input. 

#### **Scraping**

To scrape we used the following libraries:

- requests
- beautiful soup
- pandas
- numpy
- lxml
